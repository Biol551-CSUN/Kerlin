# Introduction
Today we are going to work with the penguins data to learn *RMarkdown*.

## Load libraries 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(here)
```

# Inspect the data

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

# Make a plot
This is a plot of penguins of bill length by bill depth. **Species** are in colors.  
Species are:  
  - Gentoo  
  - Adelie   
  - Chinstrap  
```{r, fig.cap = "Penguin Plot", tidy = TRUE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + #linear model
  labs(x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)") +
  theme_bw()
```
